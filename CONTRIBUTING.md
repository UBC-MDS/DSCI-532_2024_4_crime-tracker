## Contributing to the Crime-tracker project

The following outlines the procedure for proposing a change to the Crime-tracker project.

#### Fixing typos/gramatical errors
Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the source file.

#### Prerequisites
Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it's a problem. If you've found a bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal reproducible example.

#### Pull request process
- We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).
- New code should follow the Black formatting guide. 
- We use Pytest. Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.
- For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of README.md below the current development version header describing the changes made followed by your GitHub username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).
