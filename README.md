Welcome to the Vancouver Crime Tracker 2023 Dashboard!

# About
This "Crime Tracker" dashboard, designed specifically for law enforcement administrators and policymakers in the Vancouver Police Department, provides a comprehensive analytical view of crime data in Vancouver for the year 2023. Users can explore crime patterns based on location, time, and crime categories through interactive visualization and filtering options that empowers informed decision-making for resource allocation, tackling crime reduction. This dashboard features spatial heatmaps, temporal distribution, and summary statistics, offering users valuable insights into crime hotspots, temporal trends and spatial trends across neighborhoods.

## Usage
