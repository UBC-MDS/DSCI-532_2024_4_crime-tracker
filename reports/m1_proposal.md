# Milestone 1 - Dashboard proposal(Vancouver Crime Tracker)

## 1. Motivation and purpose
Our role: Data scientist consultancy firm

Target audience: Law enforcement administrators and policymakers for the Vancouver Police Department

The Vancouver Police Department plays a crucial role in ensuring public safety and maintaining the quality of life within the city. A comprehensive understanding of crime patterns is essential for effective policing and strategic resource allocation. Our "Crime Tracker" dashboard is designed to support law enforcement administrators by offering a clear, analytical view of crime data across various key dimensions such as location, time, and crime categories.

This tool facilitates a data-driven approach to law enforcement, allowing for informed decisions on where and when to deploy resources. Through interactive visualizations, the dashboard helps identify trends and hotspots, enabling administrators to prioritize areas that require immediate attention and plan preventive measures.

With the "Crime Tracker," the Vancouver Police Department can enhance their operational efficiency, responding decisively to the dynamic landscape of urban crime, ultimately striving for a safer community.

## 3. Research questions and usage scenarios

Adam Palmer is a Chief Constable at the Vancouver Police Department in British Columbia and he has come to understand that many of the citizens living in Vancouver feel extremely unsafe stepping foot outside their homes. Therefore, he wants to understand what is causing this perception, and how he can effectively manage the resources at his disposal to reduce the crimes in Vancouver. He wishes to be able to take a glance at a holistic overview of the crime data and determine which types of crimes should be targetted and what times he should be allocating most of his patrols.

When Adam logs into our "Crime Tracker app", he will see an overview of the variables available in our dataset, according to the number of crimes being committed for different categories, the times at which they were committed and the neighbourhoods in which they were commited. He can then filter-out different types of crimes, or the neighbourhoods or time, to make comparisons to determine which areas of resource allocation would be most effective for crime reduction. When he does so, Adam may perhaps notice that there seems to be a greater count of "robberies/snatchings" being committed at "night" in "Hastings"

Based on his findings from using our app, Adam hypothesizes that in order to reduce snatch/grab/run crimes, a reduction in which would make the population of Vancouver feel safe, he can allocate greater resources for patrolling in Hastings at night, in an attempt to reduce crimes there.
