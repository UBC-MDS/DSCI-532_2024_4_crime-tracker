 # Reflection at Milestone 4
Reflecting on our progress since the last milestone, our team has received generally positive feedback from peer reviews and Joel's insights. However, two major issues were consistently highlighted by reviewers: the overall layout remains unsatisfactory, and there's a need for clearer indications or labels on the map. Addressing these concerns will significantly enhance the user experience of the Crime Tracker dashboard, and they have become this week's focus for improvement. We also aim to enhance the page's load time by refining the efficiency of our data preprocessing, which will, in turn, benefit the user experience.

Firstly, we've repositioned the bar chart to the right of the sidebar to address feedback that users perceived the bar chart as static and disconnected from the sidebar. Additionally, we moved the map and line charts to the far right of the page, maintaining the prominence of the map as it is the centerpiece of our dashboard. We achieved this by resizing the bar chart to be smaller than the map and narrowing the sidebar. Aligning all charts more consistently, we now offer users a more unified visual flow, enabling a clearer connection between the sidebar functionality and the changes reflected in each chart.

Secondly, we recognized that some users misunderstood the significance of certain charts and faced difficulties interpreting the visualizations. To tackle this, we adopted a multi-pronged approach: we revised the titles of each chart for clearer representation and enhanced the hover tooltips for data points on the map and bar charts. Instead of relying on legends for color coding, we believe this approach modernizes the interface while conveying just the right amount of information. Furthermore, we've adopted a new CSS style and color scheme that align with the dashboard's narrative, offering users a cohesive view of our story.

We've also implemented several methods to reduce load times, such as vectorized data processing, usage of Parquet files, and caching. After extensive app profiling and monitoring render times, we decided to limit the data set to 5,000 points, choosing samples that best represent Vancouver. We stored the preprocessed data in a Parquet file and incorporated caching for the map chart, which had the longest render times. With all these adjustments, the dashboard now provides a smooth user experience.

Looking back, we have achieved most of our objectives with this dashboard. It has become clear to us that user experience should take precedence over the sheer density and sophistication of the information presented. Each iteration has brought us closer to creating a dashboard that is more than just a tool; it has become a narrative window into urban safetyâ€”a narrative we are committed to enhancing continuously.
